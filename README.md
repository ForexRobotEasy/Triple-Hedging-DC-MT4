---

This is an Expert Advisor (EA) for the MetaTrader 4 platform that implements a high-risk, high-profit forex strategy known as Triple Hedging DC. The EA is designed to open multiple trades simultaneously, with each trade having its own stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop parameters.

## Input Parameters

- **LotSize**: The lot size for each trade.
- **StopLoss**: The stop loss in pips.
- **TakeProfit**: The take profit in pips.
- **TrailingStop**: The trailing stop in pips.

## Global Variables

- **ticket1**, **ticket2**, **ticket3**: Trade tickets for each currency pair.
- **isTrade1Open**, **isTrade2Open**, **isTrade3Open**: Flags to check if trades are open.

## Expert Advisor Start

The EA starts by checking if all trades are closed. If all trades are closed, it proceeds to open new trades using the input parameters. The `OrderSend` function is used to open the trades, and the trade tickets are stored in the respective ticket variables.

If the trades are opened successfully, the corresponding trade flags are set to true.

If any of the trades are still open, the EA checks their status and manages them accordingly. For each open trade, it checks if the stop loss or take profit levels have been reached. If so, it closes the trade. If the trailing stop parameter is greater than 0 and the trailing stop level has been reached, it modifies the stop loss to the trailing stop level.

The process is repeated for each trade.

Finally, it checks if all trades are closed. If so, it executes the necessary code for when all trades are closed.
